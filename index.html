            <h1>Hello, I'm Gautier ðŸ¤“</h1>
            <p><strong>Organized, curious and creative</strong></p>
            <p>
              After working 7 years in music industry, I discovered a real
              passion for coding at Le Wagon Paris and I always have an overall
              view on my jobs. From the very start to the achievement, I feel
              really involved in my projects. Thanks to coding, I'm a good
              creative with valuable technical skills. <br />I decided to join
              Le Wagon Paris to change my career path. Combining organisation,
              management, and my new technical skills, I already created a
              marketplace and social media mobile application, and an artists
              booking website.

              Currently Teacher Assistant @Le Wagon Paris, co-founder @Entente
              Nocturne Festival (2 years), co-founder and producer @Forecast
              Label (5 years). I was part of the organisation of more than a
              hundred of events, from B2B events to festivals with 7500 & more
              people.
              <br />
              I am also a professional music composer, author and producer. My
              favorite sports are running, hiking, rugby & every board sport.
              Finally, another of my side-projects/passion is the audio
              electronics.
